# Bitcoin Transaction Forensic Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a two-part Python toolkit for tracing Bitcoin transactions and analysing blockchain wallet behaviour. It has been designed for use in digital forensics and investigative analysis, allowing users to extract and visualise transaction flows from a specific Bitcoin address.

The toolkit consists of:
### 1. **Data Extraction Tool**
- Script: `transaction_trace.py`
- Retrieves transaction history for a specified Bitcoin wallet using the BlockCypher API.
- Outputs a CSV file (`trace_output.csv`) containing structured transaction data.

### 2. **Data Analysis & Visualisation Tool**
- Script: `data_analysis.py`
- Loads the `trace_output.csv` and visualises the transaction graph using `networkx` and `matplotlib`.
- Useful for visually tracing funds and identifying transaction patterns.

### 3. **BlockCypher**
- An online Blockchain database used for data analysis and visualisation of wallet information.
- Used to inform investigation and to allow functionality for `transaction_trace` using API token.

## Setup Instructions

### Install dependencies (Python 3.8+ recommended):
Dependencies can be installed by running the following script:
  python dependencies.py
  
This script will install 
- pandas
- networkx
- matplotlib
- requests

### Configure API Token
Create a config.json file inside transaction_tracer_tool with your BlockCypher token in the following format:
  {
  "api_token": "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
  }

## Usage
### Step 1: Extract Transactions
cd transaction_tracer_tool
python transaction_trace.py

Enter the selected Bitcoin wallet when prompted
This transaction will be saved to /data_analysis_tool/trace_output.csv

## Step 2: Visualise the Transaction Graph and Other Features
cd ../data_analysis_tool
python data_analysis.py

This will generate a graph showing the flow of BTC from and to the target wallet, as well as receiver, sender, and BTC amount charts for analysis.

## Notes 
The transaction extraction script respects API limits by sleeping between requests
The CSV output has been specifically formatted for compatibility with other custom analysis scripts
Ensure paths between the two tools are preserved to tool functions as expected.

## How These Tools Were Used in my Investigation
This toolkit was used to support a blockchain forensics investigation by providing insight into the transaction behaviour of a targeted Bitcoin wallet. Specifically:
- The extraction tool was used to retrieve and store the complete transaction history.
- The analysis tool then visualised these transactions, highlighting the flow of funds, top walets, and transaction values.

By identifying patterns and key wallet interactions, this toolset helped establish potential links to illicit behaviour.
