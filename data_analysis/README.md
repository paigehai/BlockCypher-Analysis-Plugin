# Data Analysis & Visualisation Tool
This script fetches the full transaction history of a given Bitcoin wallet address using the BlockCypher API. It structures the transaction data into a CSV file for further analysis or visualisation.

## Input
This tool expects the file `trace_output.csv` to be present in this directory. This file is generated by the extraction tool in `../transaction_tracer_tool`.

## Usage
cd ../data_analysis_tool
python data_analysis.py

This will parse the CSV file and create a directed flow of funds graph, recipient and sender charts, and transaction amount charts.

## Notes 
The visualisation may take a moment for wallets with many transactions.
