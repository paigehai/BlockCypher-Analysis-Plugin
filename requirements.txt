These tools require a few Python libraries to run properly. To simplify setup, you can install all necessary dependencies by running the included script:

python dependencies.py

== Dependencies == 
The script will install the following Python packages via pip:
- pandas: for data handling and analysis
- networkx – for working with and visualising network graphs
- matplotlib – for plotting graphs and charts
- requests – for making HTTP requests to APIs

== Standard Library Modules ==
The following modules are part of Python's standard library and do not require installation:
- json
- os
- csv
- time

Make sure you're using Python 3.6 or higher to ensure compatibility.
